# odin-recipes

I will be creating a recipe website that has a few of my favorite foods, the ingredients, and the directions used to make them. The website will consist of the main page and links to each of the recipe pages.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated by ability to create working relative links that correctly take you to each page. I will have also demonstrated that I can successfully add images. I will use elements like ul ol and li to make my lists and steps for the recipes.
